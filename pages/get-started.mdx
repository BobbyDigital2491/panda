# About

## Mission Statement

THE GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO BUILD A FUN SPACE OF LIKE MINDED PEOPLE THAT WILL FOCUS ON GROWING THE COMMUNITY, MAKING CONNECTIONS AND PROVIDING A UNIQUE EXPERIENCE ON HEDERA.

## The Rebranding

This isn't your traditional whitepaper.…. The Pandamania Collections are
going through a phase, and it is hell. There is this quote I live by; how can
we ever appreciate heaven if we never went through the trenches of hell.
This quote has nothing to do with religion for me, but really a transitioning
period for the project and awareness of it's ups and downs.
- Regardless of the utilities we offer, still haven't sold out.
- Regardless of huge giveaways, still haven't sold out.
- Regardless of previous accomplishments, still haven't sold out.
- Regardless of team engagement and consistency... well you get it.
I have personally reached the "enough is enough" state of mind. No excuses on
why we shouldn't be performing well in the market, or why we haven't sold
out, yet. Now it's time to change and adapt to the constantly changing
market around us. For all our early supporters and new holders, alike.

## Why Hedera?

import Callout from 'nextra-theme-docs/callout'


We are stout supporters of the Hedera network for several reasons. Reasons include the nominal fees associated with the minting and transferring of NFTs, speed of token transfers, security of the network and more. They allow NFTs to become more accessible to a broader audience. 
The Hedera community’s love and support is unmatched.
Panda Syndicates originally started on ETH before two Hbarbarians got the artist to see the wonders of the Hedera community.
