<br/>

## Hashmingos HBAR Giveaway Changes
- Considering that even with a 231,000h giveaway bonus plus all other utilities DURING MINT didn’t add the expected spark the team plan for it to… We are changing things up. After the first 500 Hashmingos is sold and we giveaway the rest for GOLD and MOONSHOT TIER. A percentage of the next 500 mint will be use differently. This new use will incentivize the use of MNGO through mystery spins…

<br/>

## $MNGO Mystery Spins
This MNGO mystery spin give  everyone a chance at winning. It also gives supporters reasons to stack their MNGO for better prize levels. Each spin will be capped, these caps stands for the number of times the wheel can be spin for each 500 Hashmingos sold. As before majority of mint proceeds will be placed into a way of giving back to holders, at the same time supporting HBAR NFT community with purchasing other NFTs to be placed in the spins as rewards.
