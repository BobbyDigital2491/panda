## Collection Story

Two species with different backgrounds, environments, and demeanours have come together. As they live and intermingle in this one world, different classes have formed.
Meet the Panda Syndicates, they are the lawmakers and “high class” of this society. Then you have the Hashmingos, which are the backbone or “working class” of this society.
Unlike the Panda Syndicates, the Hashmingos consist of two strains. Their recessive gene created the Crash-Mingos. Crash-Mingos are only interested in partying and having a good time.
Although these three groups have different goals. They live in an orderly and fair society. Even Hashmingos and Panda Syndicates throw their cares to the wind and party sometimes!
